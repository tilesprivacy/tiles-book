# Tilekit

This monorepo contains both in-house and third-party libraries and tools that power the Tiles Launcher.

To download toolchains from tiles.run, use the Tilekit toolchain installer. Tiles.run toolchains support Modelfile SDK, include features like p2p distributed inference and experimental support for training multi-turn agents.

The design of this toolkit is inspired by ```git/gh```, and ```workerd``` CLIs.

## Quick Start

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.

## Documentation

This documentation site provides comprehensive information about the various components, libraries, and tools available in the Tilekit monorepo.
