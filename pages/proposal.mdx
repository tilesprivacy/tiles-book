# Proposed Implementation

Based on specs defined by Darkshapes' [MIR](https://huggingface.co/darkshapes/MIR_) (Machine Intelligence Resource), a naming schema for AIGC/ML work, and Ollama's [Modelfile](https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/modelfile/), the blueprint to create and share models:

```
FROM /Users/you/Downloads/model.safetensors
MIR          "info.stst.t5"                              # who am I?
WEIGHTS      "./t5-small.safetensors" sha256="..."       # where are my weights?
LAYOUT       "hf://.../weight_maps/....json"             # how are they packed?
BACKEND      "transformers" class="T5Model"              # who will load me?
TOKENIZER    "google-t5/t5-small"                        # tokenizer indirection
PARAMETER    dtype "bfloat16"
PARAMETER    max_position_embeddings 512```
