# Tilekit
 
Tilekit is a Rust based declarative, cross-platform [Modelfile](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile) based SDK that lets developers customize open models and agent experiences.

This document describes the Modelfile implementation in this Rust-based codebase. Our goal is to evolve Modelfile in collaboration with the community and establish it as a standard for model customization.

To begin with, we are collaborating with the [Darkshapes](https://darkshapes.org) team to support the [MIR](https://huggingface.co/darkshapes/MIR_) (Machine Intelligence Resource) model naming scheme for our Modelfile implementation while maintaining full backward compatibility with the [Ollama's implementation](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile). Learn more about how we are thinking of this model deployment problem space in our proposal on the next page. We support Hugging Face today and plan to build our own registry later, using the open source implementation in [xet-core](https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core) for model layering.
