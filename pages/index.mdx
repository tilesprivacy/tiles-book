# Tilekit
 
This toolchain is built with Swift and works as both a CLI and a library. Precompiled binaries are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, covering both stable releases and nightly builds generated via GitHub Actions.

The design of this toolchain is inspired by `git/gh`, `duckdb`, `keybase` and `workerd`.

## Documentation

This documentation covers the various components, libraries, and tools available in the Tilekit monorepo.
